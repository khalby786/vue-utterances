## Confession

I've never published a Vue component to NPM for public use and it's my first time. I followed [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-publish-a-vue-component-library/) tutorial to create this component package. I'm not familiar with the entire concept (*yet*), and I might be doing some things the wrong way, so if you feel like something needs correction or can be improved further, please create an issue/pull request!
